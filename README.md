# ABME-market

An Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate the selection of market websites based on theories of _endorsements_ (Simon and Newell) and _word of mouth_ (CITE?). For now, we have applied on chinese markets like AliExpress, Wish, BangGood, Alibaba, and BangGood. Altough this project has been applied on market websites, this project is flexible enough to apply others markets.
